# rsg-farming by devchacha

A comprehensive farming system for RedM RSG-Core, allowing you to plant, water, maintain, and harvest a wide variety of crops.

## Features
- **Ghost Placement System**: visual placement of crops with fine-tuned positioning controls.
- **Growth System**: 
  - Server-side persistent growth (ticks every minute).
  - Fertilizer boosts growth speed by 35%.
  - Visual stages of plant growth.
- **Maintenance**: 
  - Manage Water levels.
  - Remove Weeds to ensure healthy crops.
  - Monitor Plant Health.
- **Water Interaction**: 
  - Interact with natural water sources (Rivers, Lakes) and Water Pumps.
  - Fill Buckets, Drink, or Wash yourself.
- **Banned Zones**: Prevents farming in major towns and restricted areas.
- **Shop System**: NPC shops with blips to purchase seeds, tools, and fertilizer.
- **Persistence**: Crops and their status are saved in the database across restarts.

## Dependencies
- `rsg-core`
- `rsg-inventory`
- `rsg-target`
- `ox_lib`
- `oxmysql`

## Installation

### 1. Download & Place
- Download the resource and place it in your `resources` folder.
- Rename the folder to `rsg-farming`.

### 2. Database Import
- Import the `farming.sql` file into your database to create the necessary tables.

### 3. Add Items
- Copy the contents of the `items.lua` file included in this resource.
- Paste them into your shared items file (e.g., `rsg-core/shared/items.lua`).
- Ensure you have the corresponding images for these items in your inventory images folder.

### 4. Server Config
- Add `ensure rsg-farming` to your `server.cfg` file.
- **Order Matters**: Ensure it is started **after** `rsg-core`, `rsg-inventory`, and `ox_lib`.

## Configuration
Edit `config.lua` to customize the server mechanics.

### Changing Growth Time & Watering
You can adjust how long each plant takes to grow in `Config.Seeds`.
- **totaltime**: Time in minutes for full growth.
- **Watering Logic**: The system **automatically calculates water decay** based on `totaltime`.
  - A full bucket of water will last exactly **1/3rd of the growth cycle**.
  - This forces players to tend to their crops ~3 times before harvest.

**Example Config Entry:**
```lua
["Corn"] = {
    seedname = "corn_seed", 
    prop = "p_corn01x",    
    totaltime = 15,       -- 15 Minutes to grow. Needs watering every 5 mins.
    rewardcount = 2,      -- Base reward amount
    stages = { ... }      -- Multi-stage visual models
},
```

Other settings:
- **Banned Zones**: Configure areas where planting is forbidden.
- **Shop Locations**: Add or move NPC shops.
